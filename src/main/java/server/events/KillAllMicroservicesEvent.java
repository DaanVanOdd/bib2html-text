 * Once upon a night there were two innocent students sitting in the college cafeteria.
 * It was dark and rainy and they were the only living souls left in the entire building.
 * One of them went to get some fresh coffee, but instead of his return the other one only
 * got to hear the desperate screams of his colleague as he was being attacked by a mob of
 * MicroService zombies, draining all of his computing cycles.
 * ..! TBC?!
